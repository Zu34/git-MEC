Today was one of those days where I questioned more than once if my head 
was even attached to my body! These days, weeks, months even, have been 
challenging and my brain has felt the tug and pull of information 
overload, spinning lots of plates in the air, and unexpected after 
unexpected. It’s all just been a lot. And all of that stirs up feelings 
of fear that I sometimes don’t even recognize.
